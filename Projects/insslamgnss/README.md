
## INSSLAMGNSS

A GNSS/INS system typically includes a 3-axis gyroscope, a 3-axis accelerometer, a GNSS receiver, and sometimes a 3-axis magnetometer to estimate a navigation solution. Each of these sensors contribute different measurements to the GNSS/INS system.


# About

The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is a satellite configuration, or constellation, that provides satellite signals to a GNSS receiver which can be used to calculate position, velocity, and time. An inertial navigation system (INS).

# What?

 - Our accmeter 
Will utitilise This combined system to provide position, velocity, and attitude estimates of higher accuracies and with better dynamic performance than a standalone GNSS or INS system can provide.

## Why?
An acceleretometer is useful in determing the rate of change of velocity(accelerometer) of an object in motion.

## Who?

GNSS Engineers utilise an acceleretometer in determining the acceleration due to gravity of an object in motion or at rest.
