# About

The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is a satellite configuration, or constellation, that provides satellite signals to a GNSS receiver which can be used to calculate position, velocity, and time. An inertial navigation system (INS).


 - Our accmeter 
Will utitilise This combined system is able to provide position, velocity, and attitude estimates of higher accuracies and with better dynamic performance than a standalone GNSS or INS system can provide.
