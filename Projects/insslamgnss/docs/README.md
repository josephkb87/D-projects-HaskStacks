# About

The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is a satellite configuration, or constellation, that provides satellite signals to a GNSS receiver which can be used to calculate position, velocity, and time. An inertial navigation system (INS).


## Our Accmeter 

We utitilise this combined system is able to provide position, velocity, and attitude estimates of higher accuracies and with better dynamic performance than a standalone GNSS or INS system can provide.

## Embedded System Design
Our Embedded System Design utilised the teardown waterfall method.

## Hardware(I/O) Design 
Our Embedded System Hardware utilised the following parameters.
