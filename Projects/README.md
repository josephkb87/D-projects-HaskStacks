## [Haskell Projects](https://github.com/josephkb87/HaskStacks/tree/main/Projects) 

This repo focuses on an introduction to Haskell Programming by walking through three complete Haskell projects that apply the things we have learnt in [Haskell Worked Examples](https://github.com/josephkb87/HaskStacks/tree/main/HaskellWorkedExamples) .

For Haskell Worked Examples go to [Haskell Application of Worked Examples](https://github.com/josephkb87/HaskStacks/tree/main/HaskellWorkedExamples) 


## Why?
* Practical application of Haskell Programming.
