## Haskell Projects

This repo contains [Projects](https://github.com/josephkb87/HaskStacks/tree/main/Projects) made with Haskell.It focuses on an introduction to Haskell Programming by walking through three complete Haskell projects that apply the things we have learnt in [Haskell Worked Examples](https://github.com/josephkb87/HaskStacks/tree/main/HaskellWorkedExamples)
