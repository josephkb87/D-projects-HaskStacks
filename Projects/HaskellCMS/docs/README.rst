What?
  Haskell Projects focuses on an introduction to Haskell Programming by walking through three complete projects that apply the things we have learnt.

Why?
  * Practical application of Haskell Programming

Navigating a Maze
  This project builds on the *findPath*  function developed before for finding a path through a maze.

k-Means Clustering
  Partitions points into clusters, with each point belonging to the cluster with th nearest mean. As the general problem is NP hard, the standard algorithm, which is relatively rapid, is heuristic and not guaranteed to converge to a global optimum. Varying the input order, from which the initial clusters are generated, can yield different results. 
  For degenerate and malicious cases, the algorithm may take exponential time. The goal of K-Means clustering is that given
  
   * Input : A set of points represented by n-dimensional points in Euclidian space, return
   * Output : A partitioning of the points, into K clusters, in a manner that minimizes sum of distances between each point and its cluster center.
