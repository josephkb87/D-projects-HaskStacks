# HaskStacks

## What?
HaskStacks is a repository for the Haskell Stack, the Functional Programming language. 

It contains [Haskell Application of Worked Examples](https://github.com/josephkb87/HaskStacks/tree/main/HaskellWorkedExamples) and, [Haskell Projects](https://github.com/josephkb87/HaskStacks/tree/main/Projects) made with Haskell.

[Haskell Application of Worked Examples](https://github.com/josephkb87/HaskStacks/tree/main/HaskellWorkedExamples) focuses on an introduction to Haskell Programming by walking through three complete Applied Worked Examples that apply the things we have learnt, while [Haskell Projects](https://github.com/josephkb87/HaskStacks/tree/main/Projects) focuses on an introduction to Haskell Programming by walking through three complete Haskell projects that apply the things we have learnt in Worked Examples.


## Why?
Practical application of Haskell Programming


## Who?
Haskell Programming enthusiasts, beginners, programmers.

#### [Haskell Application of Worked Examples](https://github.com/josephkb87/HaskStacks/tree/main/HaskellWorkedExamples);

1. [Navigating a Maze](#). This project builds on the *findPath*  function developed before for finding a path through a maze.

2. [k-Means Clustering](#) partitions points into clusters, with each point belonging to the cluster with th nearest mean. As the general problem is NP hard, the standard algorithm, which is relatively rapid, is heuristic and not guaranteed to converge to a global optimum. Varying the input order, from which the initial clusters are generated, can yield different results. 
For degenerate and malicious cases, the algorithm may take exponential time. The goal of [K-Means clustering](#) is that given
  
   * Input : A set of points represented by n-dimensional points in Euclidian space, return
   * Output : A partitioning of the points, into K clusters, in a manner that minimizes sum of distances between each point and its cluster center.

3. [Making a Tree Parser](#)
