# About
Haskell is a typeful programming language: types are pervasive, and the newcomer is best off becoming well aware of the full power and complexity of Haskell's type system from the outset. For those whose only experience is with relatively "untypeful" languages such as Perl, Tcl, or Scheme, this may be a difficult adjustment; for those familiar with Java, C, Modula, or even ML, the adjustment should be easier but still not insignificant, since Haskell's type system is different and somewhat richer than most. 

This HaskStacks repository is not to teach programming, nor even to teach functional programming. Rather, it is intended to serve a goal to provide [a gentle introduction to Haskell](#) for someone who has experience with at least one other language, preferably a functional language (even if only an "almost-functional" language such as ML or Scheme). 

To learn more about the functional programming style, [Bird's text Introduction to Functional Programming](https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/haskell-tutorial.html#$bird98) or [Davie's An Introduction to Functional Programming Systems Using Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/haskell-tutorial.html#$davie92) would be useful to survey functional programming languages, techniques,and language design principles used in Haskell.
